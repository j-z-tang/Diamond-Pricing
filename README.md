# Diamond Price Prediction

## Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested to answer the following questions using data of diamond listings:
1. What are the four Câ€™s and how do they each affect the price?
2. Are there correlations between different features of a diamond?
3. Can we predict price with high certainty, based on its specifications alone?

## File Descriptions
The single .ipynb file in the repository shows all the code required to load, clean and build the model to predict diamond price

## Results
Main findings of the code can be found at the post [here](https://jztang.medium.com/this-is-what-your-dream-diamond-ring-is-really-worth-32d344bbe548).

## Licensing, authors, acknolwedgements
